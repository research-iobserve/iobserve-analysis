1. Structure:

1.1 Packages:
	1.1.1 org.iobserve.analysis:
	This packages contains all necessary classes to run iObserve:
		o 	AnalysisMain: The main class containing also the main-method. Is designed as singleton. A reference can
			be retrieved from everywhere using the AnalysisMain.getInstance() method.
		o 	AnalysisMainParameterBean: This class is a java bean containing command line parameter. It can be
			extended by adding new fields along with corresponding getter and setter according to the java bean
			convention. Getters are annotated with @Parameter to set their names used on the command line. 
			More information about this: https://github.com/AlessandroGiusa/giusa.tooling.cmd
			
		o	FilterTimeMemLogger: Logger to log the execution time and memory usage of each filter.
		o	ObservationConfiguration: Configuration class to configure the TeeTime pipeline. TeeTime is used as
			pipe- and filter framework.
			More information: https://teetime-framework.github.io/

	1.1.2 org.iobserve.analysis.correspondence:
	This package contains all necessary classes to realize the runtime architecture correspondence concept described
	in the basic paper page 16ff.
	
	o	ICorrespondence is the interface used in iobserve to get correspondence information between
		implementation and model. 
	o	CorrespondenceModelImpl is the current available implementation of ICorrespondence.
	o	CorrespondenceModelFactory: is the factory to get a ICorrespondence instance.
	o	Correspondent: is a java bean which is returned by the ICorrespondence.getCorrespondent(...) method. The 
		contained information can be used on the model provider (see 1.1.5) to get actual pcm elements.
	o	OperationSignatureSelector: When the correspondence model gets used to get an operation based on the provided
		class- and method-signature, it has to somehow decide which operation it should return. Since an pcm entity can
		have more than one operation and during code-generation it is not clear which operation gets implemented by
		which method, one has to somehow decide using for example the name of the method. Since this issue was not 
		clear during implementation, a selector was introduced, in order to make this part of the mapping algorithm
		inside of the correspondence model flexible. The correspondence model will use the selector to compare operation
		signature with method-signatures.
		
	1.1.3 org.iobserve.analysis.filter:
	This package is the main package of iobserve.analysis. It contains all filters performing the actual transformations
	on the models. Their are described in the basic paper page 18ff.
	
	o	RecordSwitch: This filter dispatches different types of IMonitoringRecord data to either IDeploymentRecord,
		IUndeploymentRecord, IFlowRecord or TraceMetadata. IMonitoringRecord is the base class for all this subclasses.
	o	TAllocation: This filter will create ResourceContainer, if a deployment happened on a unknown ResourceContainer.
		Input:IDeploymentRecord
	o	TDeployment: This filter will deploy a component on a ResourceContainer, if it is not yet deployed in the model.
		Input: IDeploymentRecord
	o	TUndeployment: This filter does the opposite of TDeployment.
		Input: IUndeploymentRecord
	o	TNetworkLink: When it happens that TAllocation created a new ResourceContainer in the model, then this new 
		container is not connected to any other already available container. This filter will connect the container with
		the other containers. It will get the deployed component on this new container and check in the system model,
		which other component requires the services from this component. Based on this information, it will query all
		containers of this components, requiring the "new" deployed one and connect their container with the "new" created
		one.
	o	TEntryCall: According to the basic paper page 19ff, it has to create EntryCallEvents based on the FlowEvents.
		Input: IFlowRecords
		Output: EntryCallEvent
	o	TEntryCallSequence: According to the basic paper page 19ff, it has to aggregate EntryCallEvents to a
		EntryCallSequenceModel. This is done by creating a UserSession per user. The UserSession has a list of all
		Input: EntryCallEvent
		Output: EntryCallSequenceModel
		EntryCallEvents from the specific user.
	o	TEntryEventSequence: This filter will construct the UsageModel based on the observed EntryCallSequenceModels
		and update the existing one.
		Input: EntryCallSequenceModel
		
	1.1.4 org.iobserve.analysis.filter.models:
	This packages contains all kind of models used by the filters in 1.1.3. For example the UserSession used from 
	TEntryCallSequence or the EntryCallSequenceModel used by TEntryEventSequence.
	
	1.1.5 org.iobserve.analysis.model
	This package contains all model provider and model builder. Model provider are used to load and save pcm models 
	as well as getting different elements out of a pcm models. The basic architecture is like following:
	o	AbstractModelProvider: is the base class for all different model providers.
	o	For each pcm model (i.e. System, UsageModel, ...) there is a specific model provider, providing the loading, 
		and saving facilities as well as convenient methods to query for model elements.
	o	AbstractModelBuilder: is the base class for all different model builders.
	o	For each pcm model (i.e. System, UsageModel, ...) there is a specific model builder, providing convenient methods
		to add, remove, modify pcm elements.
	
	o	ModelSaver: is used from the AbstractModelProvider to save the model. A default implementation can be get
		from AbstractModelProvider. It is a implementation which can save to a file.
		The idea behind this interface is to make it flexible how to save. It could be the case, that models are saved
		in a kind of database. Therefore a you could provide an implementation for this use case. ModelSaver is set
		by the constructor of AbstractModelProvider.
	o	ModelLoader: same as ModelSaver but loading model.
	o	ModelProviderPlatform: From this instance one can get all different model providers
	
	1.1.6 org.iobserve.analysis.utils
	This package contains some utility or general purpose stuff.
	
	1.1.7 org.iobserve.logger
	This package contains AspectJ files related to logging.
	o	FilterLogging: Is an aspcet which will log the execute time and memory usage for each filter.
	
	
1.2 Build process:
	
	1.2.1 Gradle
	Building is done via Gradle (https://gradle.org/). iobserve.analysis is a multi-build conraining the following 
	modules:
	o	org.iobserve.analysis
		- Some special tasks:
		During development and testing, one will override models, and other important stuff. In order to not lose the
		original resources, there is a taks called:
		- copyPcmToWorkingDir: it will copy everything from res/original_dir into res/working_dir. The res/working_dir
		is further used to work with during testing time.
	o	org.iobserve.common
	o	org.iobserve.monitoring
	
	Each of which has its own build.gradle file. Root project is iobserve.analysis and has as well a build file
	in order to define some common stuff like repositories and similar.
	
	In order to build a runnable jar file, one should run the following command on the command line:
	
	> gradle fatJar
	
	(of course gradle should be installed and also available in your global environment path)

	1.2.2 Used libraries
	As far as possible, libraries are retrieved using maven. But of course there are some exceptions:
	o	pcm stuff: in order to get all the pcm libraries one has to perform the step 5 and 5.1 of the 
		iobserve-analysis/doc/installation/InstallationGuide_iObserve.txt
	
	Other libraries are put in org.iobserve.analysis/libs:
	o	giusa.software.csv-1.0.jar: Simple csv-parser library:
		One can see how it is used in org.iobserve.analysis.FilterTimeMemLogger.java
	o	giusa.software.tooling.cmd-1.2.jar: Simple command line parsing library. This is used with the AnalysisMainParameterBean
		class.
		See iobserve-analysis/doc/api-usage/Parameter-Parser.txt
	o	mapping.lib.jar along with mapping_src.zip: This library comes from the protocom-extension and is used to parse
		the rac-file used form the correspondence model. It is basically a collection of java bean classes annotated with
		Java JAXB annotations in order to marshall and unmarshall xml files.
	o	net4j-utils.jar: needed from the pcm stuff
	o	org.eclipse.emf.cdo.*: also pcm related stuff
